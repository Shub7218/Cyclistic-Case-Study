# Cyclistic-Case-Study

##Introduction
The Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study is a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. In this project, I will follow the data analysis process which I learned from the course: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act to analyze the data.

##Background
Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago that launched a successful bike-sharing program in 2016. Throughout the years, the program has expanded significantly to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles and a network of 692 geotracked stations sprawled across the city. With the large number of bicycles across numerous stations, customers can rent bikes from one station and return them to any other station within the network at their convenience. This encourages people to opt for cycling as a mode of transportation, therefore contributing to the success of Cyclistic's bike-sharing program.

Cyclistic's marketing strategy has so far focused on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The company offers flexibile pricing plans that cater to diverse needs of users including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Besides, it provides reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, effectively welcoming individuals with disabilities and those who can't ride on the standard two-wheeled bicycles. Based on the company database, Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. While traditional bikes remain as the popular option, around 8% of users opt for the assistive alternatives.

The company's marketing director believes that the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, as a junior data analyst, my team and I have to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
